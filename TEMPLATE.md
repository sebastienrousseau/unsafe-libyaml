This library is a fork of [unsafe-libyaml][01], a version of [libyaml][02]
translated from C to unsafe Rust with the assistance of [c2rust][03].

This project, has been renamed to [LibYML][00] for simplicity and to avoid
confusion with the original [unsafe-libyaml][01] crate which is now
archived and no longer maintained.

## Credits and Acknowledgements

This library is a fork of the excellent work done by [David Tolnay][04] and the
maintainers of the [unsafe-libyaml][01] library.

LibYML has now evolved into a separate library with its own goals and direction
in mind and does not intend to replace the original unsafe-libyaml crate.

If you are currently using unsafe-libyaml in your projects, we recommend
carefully evaluating your requirements and considering the stability and
maturity of the original library as well as looking at the features and
improvements offered by other libraries in the Rust ecosystem.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [David Tolnay][04] and the
[unsafe-libyaml][01] and [libyaml][02] maintainers for their valuable
contributions to the Rust and C programming communities.

```toml
[dependencies]
libyml = "0.0.3"
```

Release notes are available under [GitHub releases][05].
